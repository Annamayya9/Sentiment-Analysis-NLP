# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

A sentiment analysis model that analyses the sentiment of the labelled reviews and classifies the new reviews as good or bad based on the analysis.

## Required libraries

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. Req
4. nltk
5. sklearn
6. pickle
7. joblib

## Model used

This model uses the Naive Bayes classifier to classify reviews as good or bad.

Train accuracy: 72.7%

## Usage

1. Download the four necessary files to your local drive.

2. Open and run the "sentiment_analysis_model.ipynb" file using a Jupyter Notebook environment. This file contains the code for the sentiment analysis model.

3. Open and run the "sentiment_predictor.ipynb" file in a Jupyter Notebook environment. This file contains the code to predict sentiment using the trained model.

4. Once the prediction is complete, download the CSV file containing the predicted classifications of the reviews.

Following these steps, you can run the sentiment analysis model, predict sentiment using the provided notebooks, and obtain the results in a downloadable CSV file.
